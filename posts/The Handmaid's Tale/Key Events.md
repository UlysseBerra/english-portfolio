| Chapter 1  | - Offred recalls sleeping in a repurposed gymnasium with other women.  <br>- Guards (Angels) patrol outside; Aunts patrol inside with cattle prods.  <br>- Women aren't allowed to speak but whisper to each other at night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | - Establishes Gilead as a prison-like society.  <br>- Language is already weaponised—no speaking, no names, just roles.  <br>- Flashback hints at a recent transformation of society (palimpsest metaphor).  <br>- Women are stripped of identity and autonomy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Chapter 2  | - Present-day: Offred’s room is revealed—bare, controlled, suicide-proof.  <br>- Her role as a Handmaid becomes clearer.  <br>- Introduced to the social hierarchy: Wives (blue), Marthas (green), Handmaids (red).  <br>- She collects tokens for shopping.  <br>- Hears gossip from Marthas (e.g. stabbing, poisoning, stillbirths).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | - The regime masks control with faux “comfort.”  <br>- Even mundane things like sheets become symbols of conformity.  <br>- Gossip becomes a subversive survival tool.  <br>- Tokens = infantilisation and control.  <br>- Offred is aware of how tightly regulated everything is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Chapter 3  | - Offred remembers her first day at the Commander’s house.  <br>- Meets Serena Joy, who was once a TV gospel singer.  <br>- Serena smokes (illicit), reminds Offred to stay out of her sight.  <br>- Serena is bitter, possessive over the Commander.  <br>- Offred notices the Wife’s obsessive knitting and garden.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | - Introduction of the power dynamic in the house: Serena vs. Offred.  <br>- Serena's past as a public figure adds layers of irony to her current status.  <br>- Domesticity becomes performative and symbolic (e.g. knitting “for the war effort”).  <br>- Bitterness of Wives shows Handmaids aren't the only victims, but they're the most disposable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Chapter 4  | - Offred sees Nick, the Commander’s Guardian, who winks at her—a subtle rebellion or a test.  <br>- Offred meets Ofglen; Handmaids must always travel in pairs.  <br>- Ofglen mentions a military victory over Baptist rebels.  <br>- At a checkpoint, young Guardians flirt subtly with Offred.  <br>- Offred reciprocates with a small glance—secret resistance.  <br>- Reflection on sex and desire in a repressed society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | - Surveillance and paranoia.  <br>- Institutionalized patriarchy: Guardians’ roles tied to sexual access.  <br>- Power through sexuality—Offred’s “small power” in being desired.  <br>- Fear and control as methods of maintaining order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Chapter 5  | - Offred and Ofglen shop at stores with biblical names (All Flesh, Milk and Honey).  <br>- Gilead is named for a biblical region; signs are pictorial, not written—women are forbidden from reading.  <br>- Janine (now Ofwarren) is visibly pregnant and flaunts it.  <br>- Flashbacks to Luke, their daughter, and old domestic life.  <br>- Encounter with Japanese tourists. Tourists ask if Handmaids are happy; Offred lies and says yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | - Language and literacy as tools of control.  <br>- Nostalgia for pre-Gilead life, especially motherhood.  <br>- Weaponization of reproduction—Janine’s pregnancy = status.  <br>- Control of image vs. truth—Offred performs happiness under surveillance.  <br>- “Freedom from” vs. “freedom to” (Aunt Lydia’s ideology).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Chapter 6  | - Offred and Ofglen pass a church-turned-museum (symbolic desecration of faith).  <br>- Harvard University implied as the setting.  <br>- They walk past the Wall: 6 bodies hanged, doctors executed for pre-Gilead abortions.  <br>- Bodies marked with fetus signs—crimes retroactively punished.  <br>- Offred reflects on Luke and Aunt Lydia’s words.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | - Theocracy and retroactive justice.  <br>- Gilead’s selective, repressive interpretation of religion (Old Testament).  <br>- Women’s bodies as state property—punishment of abortionists.  <br>- Historical irony: Puritan roots of Harvard become dystopian present.  <br>- Death as spectacle and social control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Chapter 7  | - Offred remembers Moira and her old dorm room life.  <br>- Flashback to a childhood moment: her mother at a park protest burning porn magazines.  <br>- Remembers waking up drugged and being told her daughter was taken.  <br>- Imagines herself telling her story to someone, since she can’t write it down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | - Memory as both trauma and resistance: Offred’s fragmented recall reflects psychological damage, but telling her story gives her agency.  <br>- Offred imagining a listener = symbolic survival. Framing her life as a story makes it feel less terrifying and more endurable.  <br>- Atwood critiques both feminist and conservative extremism: the burning of porn by feminists echoes Gilead’s repression—both aim to control women’s sexuality.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Chapter 8  | - Offred and Ofglen see new bodies on the Wall: a priest and two "gender traitors" (aka gay men).  <br>- They pass a funeral procession: Econowives with a jar containing a dead embryo.  <br>- An Econowife spits on Offred.  <br>- Serena Joy is seen gardening; Offred reflects on her hypocrisy.  <br>- The Commander is lurking outside Offred’s room, which is not allowed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | - Gilead uses violence and fear to police gender and sexuality. “Gender treachery” shows how queerness is criminalized.  <br>- Serena Joy embodies internalized misogyny—she helped build Gilead’s ideology and now suffers under it, yet still mistreats Offred.  <br>- Women enforcing the system on each other (Serena, Econowives, Aunts) = one of Gilead’s most brutal survival mechanisms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Chapter 9  | - Flashback: Offred remembers renting hotel rooms with Luke before they were married.  <br>- She explores the Commander’s house and finds the Latin phrase "Nolite te bastardes carborundorum" scratched in her closet.  <br>- She imagines the previous Handmaid as strong, maybe like Moira.  <br>- Rita is evasive about the previous Handmaids who stayed in Offred’s room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | - Offred regrets not valuing freedom pre-Gilead, esp the privacy of her own space.  <br>- The Latin phrase becomes a symbol of female resistance and solidarity.  <br>- Offred clings to traces of past rebellion to keep her sanity—finding the phrase gives her a tiny sense of connection and empowerment.  <br>- Moira continues to be an imagined symbol of defiance and irreverence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Chapter 10 | - Offred sings “Amazing Grace” and Elvis songs in her head.  <br>- Music is mostly forbidden in Gilead. Serena sometimes listens to old recordings of herself singing gospel.  <br>- Summer’s coming; Handmaids will switch to lighter dresses.  <br>- Aunt Lydia used to describe the dangers of “the past,” like women wearing bikinis and being assaulted.  <br>- Offred recalls Moira’s “underwhore” party selling lingerie.  <br>- She remembers how violence against women used to feel distant and abstract.  <br>- She sits by a window, watching the Commander leave, and stares at a cushion embroidered with the word “Faith”—the only word she’s allowed to read. | - Isolation = loud. No music, no community, barely any stimulation. Offred clings to memories, words, and symbols like “Faith” just to feel something.  <br>- Offred’s nostalgia highlights how Gilead twisted “protection” into surveillance and oppression. Even lingerie becomes revolutionary in retrospect.  <br>- The flashbacks show Offred's slow realization that even the pre-Gilead world wasn’t safe for women—just dangerous in a different flavor.  <br>- Religious language is aestheticized but emptied of meaning, like “Faith” reduced to home decor, not belief.                                                               |
| Chapter 11 | - Monthly doctor visit: she gets tested for pregnancy and disease. A Guardian escorts her.  <br>- Doctor isn’t supposed to see her face or talk, but he chats anyway.  <br>- He offers to impregnate her, claiming many Commanders are sterile.  <br>- “Sterile” is an illegal word in Gilead—officially, only women can be “barren.”  <br>- Offred refuses out of fear: both of getting caught and of the offer itself.  <br>- If the doctor wanted to, he could report her and send her to the Colonies.                                                                                                                                                                    | - Patriarchy gaslights women into thinking all fertility issues are their fault—Gilead bans the idea of male sterility even though it’s clearly a thing.  <br>- The doctor shows how people subvert the regime in secret... but also how even “nice” men still exploit power imbalances.  <br>- Offred’s fear reveals internalized oppression—she’s so used to being controlled that freedom itself feels threatening.  <br>- Gilead’s system contradicts itself: it needs children, but its policies make conception harder, not easier.                                                                                                         |
| Chapter 12 | - It’s bath day. There’s no mirror, no razor, no lock. Cora waits outside.  <br>- Offred feels estranged from her own body—remembers how public it used to be in swimsuits etc.  <br>- She remembers a time when a woman tried to kidnap her daughter at the grocery store.  <br>- She’s had no contact with her daughter since Gilead took her away at age five.  <br>- Aunt Lydia used to preach “poverty of spirit” and quote “Blessed are the meek,” but omitted the part about inheriting the earth.  <br>- After the bath, she eats bland food, hides butter in her shoe.  <br>- She reflects on Serena and the Commander dining downstairs, separate from her.         | - Even bathing—once mundane—is now regulated and monitored. Loss of privacy is total.  <br>- Her body doesn’t feel like hers anymore. Gilead has stripped it of autonomy and sexuality—it’s just a vessel.  <br>- Memories of her daughter = pain but also rebellion. Remembering is resistance.  <br>- The Bible is weaponized in Gilead. They quote scripture selectively to justify control, stripping it of hope or justice.  <br>- Hiding butter shows micro-resistance. A tiny act of agency in a world where she has nearly none.                                                                                                          |
| Chapter 13 | - Offred compares herself to bored women in harem paintings, realizing the eroticism is rooted in boredom and objectification.  <br>- At the Red Center, Moira arrives; she and Offred secretly connect, hiding their friendship.  <br>- Janine testifies about being gang-raped; other women are forced to chant that it was her fault.  <br>- Offred reflects on how her body is now reduced to a womb—menstruation = failure.  <br>- Flashback to escape attempt with her daughter, ending in capture and separation.                                                                                                                                                      | - The boredom in the harem mirrors the forced passivity of Handmaids—boredom is erotic only when it’s tied to domination.  <br>- Gilead isolates women by making friendship dangerous, destroying trust and solidarity.  <br>- The “Testifying” scene weaponizes internalized misogyny—women are turned into enforcers of their own oppression.  <br>- Offred’s sense of bodily autonomy is gone; she’s a “walking uterus,” her value tied entirely to fertility.  <br>- The memory of her daughter’s capture is core trauma—Offred’s guilt and powerlessness make her more compliant.                                                            |
| Chapter 14 | - Offred eats, bathes, and prepares for the Ceremony; she kneels while others stand.  <br>- Nick’s foot brushes hers deliberately—brief moment of forbidden contact.  <br>- They watch the news while waiting. Canada is blocked. Religious propaganda dominates.  <br>- The news reports spies smuggling “national resources” and the arrest of Quakers.  <br>- The “resettlement of the Children of Ham” is announced, with vague fate.  <br>- Flashback: Offred and Luke bought fake passports, planned to sedate their daughter and escape by car.                                                                                                                        | - The Ceremony process feels like a performance—everyone has a “role” but the power dynamics are brutal and rigid.  <br>- Nick’s foot-touch = human connection in a world of forced alienation. Even tiny rebellions matter.  <br>- Propaganda keeps people obedient by controlling what information they get—Canada is the symbol of unreachable freedom.  <br>- The “Children of Ham” reference ties Gilead to biblical racism—it’s ethnic cleansing dressed in scripture.  <br>- The escape flashback reminds us Gilead’s power was not gradual—it required sudden, desperate decisions to survive.                                            |
| Chapter 15 | - The Commander arrives, opens a locked box, and reads the Bible aloud.  <br>- He reads Genesis: Rachel gives her maid to Jacob as a surrogate.  <br>- Serena sobs quietly during the reading.  <br>- Handmaids used to hear the Bible through male recordings—Aunts couldn’t read it aloud.  <br>- Flashback: Moira fakes illness and tries to seduce an Angel to escape, but he reports her.  <br>- Her punishment: her feet are beaten with steel cables. Hands would be next for repeat offenses.  <br>- Aunt Lydia says hands and feet aren’t necessary for Handmaids.                                                                                                   | - Gilead uses selective scripture to justify oppression—reality is shaped to fit religious myth, not the other way around.  <br>- Serena’s quiet sobbing shows she’s not immune to the trauma, even if she’s complicit.  <br>- Denying women access to the Bible = absolute control over knowledge and interpretation.  <br>- Moira’s resistance contrasts Offred’s passivity—her failed attempt shows how hard escape is.  <br>- Aunt Lydia’s comment reveals the chilling utilitarianism of Gilead: women are reduced to wombs; everything else is dispensable.                                                                                 |
| Chapter 16 | - The Ceremony takes place with Offred lying between Serena's legs while the Commander has sex with her.  <br>- Serena clutches Offred's hands hard, and the Commander leaves immediately after.  <br>- Serena tells Offred to leave before she can rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | - The Ceremony is brutally mechanical and devoid of intimacy; the ritual emphasizes power and dehumanization.  <br>- Offred distances herself emotionally and linguistically, choosing the word “fucking” to describe it.  <br>- It’s ritual rape disguised as sacred duty; Offred can’t even label it rape due to Gilead’s twisted definition of consent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Chapter 17 | - Offred uses stolen butter as lotion because she lacks beauty products.  <br>- She sneaks downstairs to steal a daffodil and runs into Nick.  <br>- They kiss; she considers sleeping with him but stops.  <br>- Nick says the Commander wants to see her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | - The butter symbolizes her longing for normalcy and control over her body.  <br>- The kiss with Nick introduces danger and desire, showing her suppressed humanity and loneliness.  <br>- The Commander's secret summons hints at forbidden power dynamics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Chapter 18 | - Offred lies in bed imagining three scenarios about Luke: dead, imprisoned, or free.  <br>- She believes all at once to cope with the unknown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | - Her simultaneous belief in contradictory outcomes is a survival mechanism.  <br>- It reveals how uncertainty is weaponized in Gilead—absence of truth becomes psychological torture.  <br>- The ambiguity keeps hope alive but also traps her in limbo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Chapter 19 | - Offred dreams of her daughter and mother, waking with sadness.  <br>- A Birthmobile comes to take her to witness Janine’s (Ofwarren’s) birth.  <br>- Aunt Lydia's indoctrination speeches about “Unbabies” and toxic femininity are recalled.  <br>- The wives also arrive to attend the birth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | - The dream of motherhood reveals how deeply Gilead has severed Offred from her past and identity.  <br>- The communal birth shows how reproduction has become a collective obsession.  <br>- Aunt Lydia’s rhetoric shows how Gilead blames women even for the fertility rates drop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Chapter 20 | - Janine is in labor; her Wife pretends to birth alongside her.  <br>- Offred recalls Aunt Lydia showing porn to the Handmaids to scare them.  <br>- She remembers seeing her mother at a feminist rally in one of the films.  <br>- Reflects on their strained relationship and her current regret.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | - Gilead uses patriarchal critiques of patriarchy to justify worse oppression—weaponizing feminist discourse.  <br>- Offred’s mother becomes a symbol of lost feminist legacy; the personal becomes political and vice versa.  <br>- Birth and sex are both co-opted and controlled to maintain systemic power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Chapter 21 | - The Handmaids chant to support Janine during labor.  <br>- Offred speaks to another Handmaid about Moira and gives a description.  <br>- They’re interrupted by an Aunt; names and past identities must remain secret.  <br>- A baby girl is born healthy and handed to the Wife, who names her Angela.  <br>- Janine will be moved to a new Commander after nursing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | - Naming and identity are dangerous acts in Gilead—names are power, and secrecy is survival.  <br>- Janine’s temporary success brings her safety but no autonomy.  <br>- The transfer of the baby to the Wife is ritualized erasure of the biological mother.  <br>- The name "Angela" suggests purity, but the system is anything but.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Chapter 22 | - Offred recalls how Moira escaped from the Red Center.  <br>- Moira caused a toilet to overflow, then threatened Aunt Elizabeth with a piece of metal (a toilet lever).  <br>- She forced Aunt Elizabeth into the furnace room, swapped clothes with her, and used her pass to walk out.  <br>- No one has seen Moira since.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | - Moira becomes a legendary figure in Offred’s narrative—a symbol of courage, rebellion, and nonconformity.  <br>- Her use of improvised violence and disguise shows both her ingenuity and how limited resources force women to be creative.  <br>- The clothing swap is symbolic—Moira seizes power by co-opting the uniform of her oppressor, subverting the rigid Gileadean hierarchy of appearance.  <br>- Her escape plants a seed of resistance in Offred, even if it feels distant and unattainable.                                                                                                                                      |
| Chapter 23 | - Offred tells Cora about Janine’s baby; Cora expresses hope Offred will conceive.  <br>- That night, Offred secretly meets the Commander in his study.  <br>- She’s terrified—Serena could send her to the Colonies, the Commander could destroy her.  <br>- But instead of sex, he offers a game of Scrabble.  <br>- After playing, he asks for a kiss. She gives him one, and he says he wants her to kiss him “as if [she] meant it.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | - The Commander’s behavior is shockingly casual and even playful, which makes it more creepy, not less.  <br>- Scrabble is a low-key revolutionary act—language is forbidden to women, so playing the game becomes illicit, even intimate.  <br>- Offred is disoriented: she expected coercion, not this weird, soft-spoken paternalism. But it’s still manipulation.  <br>- His request for a kiss “like she meant it” shows the male entitlement to not just a woman’s body, but her emotional labor too.  <br>- Offred’s comparison to Moira highlights the powerlessness she feels in contrast—she imagines killing him, but can only comply. |
| Chapter 24 | - Offred returns to her room, deeply shaken by the encounter.  <br>- She decides she must forget her past identity and work within the rules of her current life.  <br>- She remembers a Holocaust documentary—specifically a Nazi’s mistress who claimed ignorance of the atrocities.  <br>- The woman later committed suicide.  <br>- Offred finds herself laughing uncontrollably at the absurdity of her situation.  <br>- She hides in the closet and falls asleep on the floor beneath the Latin graffiti: Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.                                                                                                                           | - The flashback to the Nazi mistress draws a chilling parallel: complicity isn’t always monstrous—it’s ordinary, human.  <br>- “How easy it is to invent a humanity” is one of the novel’s most devastating lines—it points to how people justify cruelty through personal connection.  <br>- Offred’s laughter is a breakdown moment, but also a resistance—laughter in the face of dystopia becomes a kind of rebellion.  <br>- The closet becomes a liminal space—a womb of sorts—where memory, trauma, and resistance meet.  <br>- The Latin phrase becomes a private motto, a spark of solidarity with the past Handmaid who left it.        |
