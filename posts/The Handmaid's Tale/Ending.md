Well that was a frustrating ending. No clear confirmation of whether they are rescuing her or arresting her, At first, I felt cheated, because Atwood had carefully built up so much tension, only to leave us without a clear resolution. I wanted to know if Offred was saved or condemned, if she ever found freedom or if she remained trapped in Gileadean oppression.

But then after I reflected about it I guess I can understand that this open ending is a deliberate narrative choice that reinforces the novel’s core themes. Doesn’t make it any less frustrating but I do get the point. The uncertainty reflects the oppressive nature of totalitarian regimes, where truth is always manipulated, and individuals never truly know their fate. It also highlights the limited perspective we as readers have just like Offred herself. We experience her world through her eyes, but we are just as blind to the larger picture as she is.

After reading the Historical Notes section, which presents Gilead’s story as a subject of academic study far in the future, I felt an even deeper sense of discomfort. While it confirmed that Gilead eventually fell, it also showed how easily real human suffering can become a mere topic of detached scholarly debate. The professors discuss Offred’s narrative with a clinical, almost dismissive attitude, which might be there to make us as readers question how we approach and study historical trauma.
