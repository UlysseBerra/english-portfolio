This creative task led me to develop my research and thinking skills, as it required me to research the Fox News style of writing, which is not a source I usually refer to. However, however disgusted I might have been by the content, I still had to focus on the form, on the authorial choices they made and their significance, in order to model them in my own writing. It also required me to keep an open mind, in order to critically consider the writing, without getting too caught up in the content, and to be reflective about my own writing and choices in order to write the rationale.
