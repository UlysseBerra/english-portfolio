* title  
  * the word “feel” appears in the title but is also the start of the entire first verse “I feel…”  
  * shows the more introspective and honest nature of the song compared to ELEMENT., the previous one  
* no official music video  
* intro  
  * the line “ain’t nobody praying for me” is repeated  
  * this line was present in ELEMENT. already, where he states that nobody was praying for him but “\[he didn’t\] give a fuck”  
  * however, this time, Lamar realizes no one is praying for him, and he realizes that he does actually give a fuck  
  * establishes the idea that Kendrick is deeply alone, with his prayers seemingly unanswered and no one else praying for him  
* verse 1  
  * “I feel” → Lamar’s emotions, more blunt and direct  
  * image of having a “chip on his shoulder” → metaphor for lingering resentment tied to feelings of inferiority → weight of racial injustice  
  * losing focus and patience → personal issues but also about his place in the music industry  
  * metaphor of thoughts being “in the basement” to illustrate how his ideas are undervalued and hidden away  
  * misinterpretation of his work, how media figures (like those on Fox News) twist his message  
  * tone shifts from introspective to a blunt call-out to those who misinterpret his words  
  * fame altering his personal relationships → friendships are “overrated” and driven solely by his financial success  
* verse 2  
  * Lamar feels like people around him are just using him  
  * those thoughts only go away when he is on stage and realizes he is a legend  
  * shows how music is the only escape from the environment he feels trapped in where everyone in the music industry is trying to use him  
  * commentary about the capitalist system, explaining how people, including the people he knew in Compton are dying and kids are indoctrinated in order for banks to keep making money  
  * lack of hope for the future, Lamar coming to terms with that feeling “not awkward”, just “toxic”  
  * where the first verse was about his own feelings, the second one is about broader systemic issues like racism and capitalism  
* outro  
  * repeats the intro lines “ain’t nobody praying for me”  
  * the epanadiplosis emphasizes that idea that he is all alone, and even music which is his only escape, is filled with people trying to use him for their own goals  
* global issues  
  * mental health and isolation  
  * systems of oppression (notably capitalism and racism here)
