This excerpt is from the start of Chapter 2 of Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë. In the text, Jane is locked in the red room due to her fighting with her cousin. Brontë builds an atmosphere of tension and suspense in this excerpt through detailed descriptions of the red room’s oppressive environment, the narrator’s fearful and isolated perspective, and the use of pathetic fallacy, using weather as a reflection of her emotions.

First, Brontë establishes a strong sense of unease through her vivid descriptions of the room. Throughout the excerpt, there is a strong presence of the color red. For example, the “deep red damask” (lines 5-6) or the “crimson cloth” (line 8). This makes sense, the room is called the “red room”, after all. However, we can also see the symbolism this creates. Red is often used to convey danger, passion, or violence. Thus, the description of the red tones of the room is a first factor in creating unease throughout the text. Additionally, the furniture is described as massive, dark, and wooden in the text, “the wardrobe, the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany” (lines 9-10), while the bed is a clear, bright white color, “the piled-up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles counterpane” (lines 11-12). This creates a very unsettling effect, due to the contrast between dark furniture and white drapes. Lastly, the oppressive atmosphere of the room is reinforced by references to the room’s “grandeur” (line 20\) and “solemnity” (line 15). This shows the room’s isolation and coldness mirror Jane’s feelings of being cut off from warmth, both physically and emotionally.

Secondly, Jane’s emotions of fear and loneliness are directly reflected in the descriptions of her surroundings. Jane says “I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then my courage sank” (lines 26-27). This parallelism in the structure reflects how as she physically gets colder, she also gets more afraid and numb. The same process is used when the bed is described as a “tabernacle” (line 6), or the chair as a “pale throne” (line 13). By using those paraphrases, simple pieces of furniture evoke an eerie reverence for death and authority (in this case, that of churches).  Jane’s dread of the room is intensified by her awareness of its association with death (specifically Mr. Reed’s death) and her own vulnerability as a child.

Lastly, Brontë uses the pathetic fallacy by making the weather outside reflect the oppressive tension within the red room. This idea of weather reflecting the plot comes back nearly everywhere throughout the book, and this scene is a great example of that. As night begins to fall and Jane gets colder and more afraid, she hears “the rain still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling in the grove behind the hall” (25-26). Storms being often associated with fear and change, this description mirrors Jane’s growing fear and unease. The transition from “drear twilight” (line 25\) to darkness as “daylight began to forsake the red-room” (line 24\) parallels Jane’s sinking courage, since nighttime and the dark have been associated with fear and the unknown as long as humans have lived. In this excerpt, weather acts as an external representation of Jane’s internal turmoil, enhancing the atmosphere of suspense.

In conclusion, Brontë creates tension and suspense in this excerpt by describing the red room’s environment, showing Jane’s emotional state, and using pathetic fallacy. The repeated use of red and the contrast between dark and light furniture make the room feel oppressive. Jane’s fear and loneliness are mirrored in how she describes her surroundings, with references to death and authority adding to the unease. The weather outside reflects Jane’s growing fear and reinforces the atmosphere of tension. These elements work together to show Jane’s isolation and set up the emotional tone for the rest of the novel.
