- greek Pantheon observing humanity millenia even after they stopped being worshipped
- as they watch humanity evolve, their commentary becomes a mirror for human anxieties about meaning and obsolescence
- intended reader
	- reflective readers interested in mythology and in exploring existential themes
- first-person rotating narration, limited perspective from different gods
	- allows us to contrast the vast timeless nature of the gods with a deeply personal fractured internal narrative. Each god is given a voice to explore their reaction to being forgotten: bitterness, curiosity, boredom, hope, etc
	- makes gods seem vulnerable and introspective, challenges the readerâ€™s expectations of divinity, encourages reflection on mortality and relevance
- fragmented, episodic structure
	- each chapter is a standalone observation or reflection from one god, loosely following human history
	- mimic the non-linear perception of time by immortal beings
	- evokes disorientation and contemplation, encourages the reader to piece together meaning across that discontinuity
- motifs and symbols
- language style
	- elevated, poetic prose with moments of informal, even humorous interjections
	- different registers and tones from different gods
- irony, ambiguity, or paradox
	- 
- other things?
