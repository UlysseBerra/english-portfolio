* title  
  * both transcription of AAVE “yeah” (cultural background, racism, etc.) and shortened form of Yahweh (the god of the Bible)  
  * connects to what are arguably the two main themes of the album  
  * personal narrative, introspection, spiritual questioning  
* no official music video  
* first verse  
  * melancholic and introspective in style  
  * juxtaposition between what he is doing by following his intuition (keeping his family close) and the sort of life he could be living (making copious sums of money, fucking numerous women)  
  * refers to how although he is clearly one of the most successful rappers alive, he is worried he’s going to burn out  
  * connects to the idea that wealth and success didn’t change him, he is still the same  
  * he acknowledges that despite his life being confusing, he is still connected to his family and wife  
* chorus  
  * radars is buzzing (links to first verse discussion of so many things happening in his life)  
  * the radars buzzing is Kendrick realizing the negative effects of everything happening around him on him  
  * can be interpreted as saying the sound his radars make when buzzing is “yah” → the radar is a message from god himself guiding him  
* second verse  
  * interviewers and the media wanting to know his thoughts and opinions → first verse  
  * Fox/Rivera brought up again, themes of racism  
  * niece as an example of people knowing him through the lens of Fox News rather than for who he truly is, and thus says someone should let Geraldo know he has more ambition and insight than he thinks  
  * “I’m not an Israelite, don’t call me black no mo’”  
    * refers to a religious movement claiming that Black Americans are god’s chosen people and descendants of biblical Israelites  
    * the idea that the word black has lost meaning in relation to people and is only a color now → personal culture, racism  
  * religious part  
    * mention of the cousin refers to the voicemail we hear later in the album  
    * “I know He walks the Earth” mirrors Leviticus 26:12  
    * “I know we all been cursed” refers to the main theme of the album where Lamar realizes Black people have been cursed and must follow god’s 10 commandments for their lives to get better, or if played backwards, where it leads to god walking the Earth in the shape of an old lady and taking his life  
* global issues  
  * how social mobility changes environments but not the people themselves  
  * how the media shapes people’s perception of celebrities  
  * how religion can act as a guide to navigate confusing situations
