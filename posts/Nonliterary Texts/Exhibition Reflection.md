Indeed, while it allows for the elimination of what could be seeds to a larger issue, it does raise questions about what it may open doors to (freedom of speech suppression) and, more importantly, whether making a martyr out of the canceled person or situation might not in fact make it more desirable (as it appears to be unfairly targeted).
