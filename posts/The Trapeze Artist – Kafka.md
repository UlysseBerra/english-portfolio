Word choice: Kafka’s word choice is formal yet descriptive, often emphasizing the isolation and rigidity of the trapeze artist’s life. Words like “seclusion,” “inevitable,” and “torment” highlight the artist’s detachment and internal struggles. His needs are described as “modest,” underscoring his singular focus on perfection.

Tone: the tone is detached and observational, almost clinical, but shifts to empathetic when the manager witnesses the trapeze artist’s emotional breakdown. The balance between admiration for the artist’s skill and concern for his mental state adds layers of complexity.

Dialogue: there is only one piece of dialogue, which is “Only the one bar in my hands—how can I go on living\!”. The fact that this is the only piece of dialogue emphasizes the moment’s importance.

Sensory details: while Kafka doesn’t overload the text with sensory details, he provides just enough to paint a picture of the trapeze artist’s environment. Descriptions of the “dusky vault,” the “sun and fresh air,” and the “great height of the roof” evoke a sense of both isolation and beauty. “Sun and fresh air came pouring irresistibly into the dusky vault” contrasts the artist’s physical surroundings with his emotional confinement.

Figurative language: the story is full of symbolism. The trapeze represents the artist’s pursuit of perfection, while his isolation symbolizes the sacrifices demanded by such devotion. The second trapeze could be seen as a metaphor for the unattainable fulfillment the artist seeks, despite his achievements.
