I chose the form of a collage because I believe it is the most fit for representing identity. Indeed, identity is never a clear-cut, monolithic representation of a person. It is a dynamic, ever-changing, multidimensional construct based on many different facets, each being more or less salient based on the context. The collage allows for a snapshot of a person’s identity as they feel it is best represented at a certain point in time, while representing a few facets of the person’s identity rather than attempting to capture it in a single image. Explanations, left to right, top to bottom:

1. My passport. This is my French passport. I was raised in France. This object represents the facet of my identity which is shaped by my childhood in France. However, my passport also reflects the more international side of my identity, since passports represent our connection to the world beyond borders.  
2. Line 5 of the Parisian metro. I like trains. More specifically, this line, along with line 9, is my favorite piece of public transportation in the world. Line 5 is the line I grew up on—it’s what I associate with home and familiarity. At the same time, it represents movement and exploration, as public transport in general is a symbol of how we connect to the city and its people. For me, this line is a metaphor for growth: staying grounded in our roots while always moving forward.  
3. Coffee. This picture is my best attempt at latte art so far. This represents my willingness to learn and to consistently practice until I get results, as well as my attention to detail through the hobby of coffee brewing (and all the chemistry it involves).  
4. A screenshot of my 2024 Spotify wrapped. Music is a huge part of my life, and I rarely spend more than a couple hours awake without listening to music one way or another. This screenshot represents the time I spend every day listening to music (over 1.5 hours on average, just on Spotify).  
5. Finally, my desk. It is the place where all aspects of my life, from school, to hobbies, to my personal life converge. It isn’t meant to be neat, but rather for me to get things done. Therefore, it constantly evolves as my needs for a workspace evolve. This thus represents the dynamic aspect of identity.
