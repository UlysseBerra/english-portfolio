Tiresias is characterized as an intermediary between the gods and humanity. His cryptic diction and grandiloquent tone creates ethos, positioning him in this liminal space between the divine and the mundane. Where Creon uses “the law” to refer by metonymy to, essentially, himself, Tiresias uses “the gods” to reflect his own position. However, the difference lies in that Tiresias is a *representative* of the gods, whereas Creon *makes* the law. Later in the excerpt, his tone becomes more accusative, as the gods grow tired of Creon’s hubris and refusal to listen to their messenger.
