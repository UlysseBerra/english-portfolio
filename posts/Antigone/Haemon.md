- acknowledging his position -> ethos
- aware of his position in the familial hierarchy
- use of logos (wouldn’t defend Antigone if she had done something wrong, he is defending her, ergo she is innocent)
- Antigone is a human before being a criminal -> pathos
- heavily emotionally charged language
- Antigone’s actions as rooted in familial love and loyalty
- Haemon only breaks character out of desperation for his father’s despotism
- emotional catharsis, breaking the bond between them

Haemon’s argument is strikingly balanced, as is common in Greek oratory culture. To convince his father, he uses an emphatic tone and flattery to build an emotionally charged discourse, and a series of strong logical implications to force Creon to accept Antigone’s innocence. He establishes his own ethos by acknowledging his own position in the familial hierarchy, but also Antigone’s by rooting her actions in not a defiance against the law, but simply in loyalty and love for her family, values which he knows to be important to his father.
