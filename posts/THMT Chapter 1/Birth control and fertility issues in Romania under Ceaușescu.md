From 1965 to 1989 under Ceaușescu, Romania had the most aggressive pronatalist and anti-birth control policies in modern history. His regime saw population growth as key to national strength and economic success, leading to Decree 770 in 1966, which severely restricted abortion and contraception.

Before 1966, Romania had one of the highest abortion rates in Europe, as abortion was the primary method of birth control due to a lack of contraceptive access. Decree 770 criminalized abortion except in extreme cases (risk to the mother’s life, rape, or, interestingly enough, women over 40 with at least four children). All forms of birth control were also either outlawed or made nearly impossible to obtain. The state clearly saw citizens as resources for economic growth, rather than autonomous individuals.

- working women had mandatory monthly gynecological exams at workplaces to detect pregnancies
- married couples without children paid extra taxes
- parents with five or more children received small financial rewards (insignificant compared to the widespread poverty)

Birth rates initially spiked, but forcing citizens to have more children without improving material conditions obviously had dire consequences.

- with no access to contraception or safe medical procedures, many women resorted to underground networks, leading to one of the highest maternal mortality rates in Europe (nearly 10 000 women are estimated to have died from botched abortions)
- unable to support large families in an economy built on state extraction rather than public welfare, thousands of parents abandoned their children. Underfunded state-run orphanages became overcrowded, leading to mass neglect and abuse
- some women mutilated themselves to avoid pregnancy, while others abandoned or even killed newborns, trapped in a system that saw them as nothing more than producers of future laborers

By the 1980s, Romania’s economy was crumbling due to Ceaușescu’s obsession with repaying foreign debt at the expense of the people’s welfare. Women were expected to raise the next generation of workers for a system that refused to provide even basic necessities. After Ceaușescu’s execution in 1989, abortion was immediately legalized again, and birth rates dropped sharply, which just goes to show that people weren’t having more children because they felt they could provide for them but simply because they were forced to.
