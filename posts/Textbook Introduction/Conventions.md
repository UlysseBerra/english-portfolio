The conventions of different types of text develop over time as a response to the shifting dynamics of society, culture, and the evolving needs of their audiences. Each form of writing—be it poetry, drama, fiction, or nonfiction—begins within a specific cultural context, shaped by the norms and expectations of that time. These conventions are not static; they are molded by the interaction between tradition and innovation. Writers initially adhere to established conventions to communicate effectively within their society, but as they push boundaries and experiment with new ideas, these conventions gradually shift and transform.

Over time, as society changes, so too do the expectations and demands placed upon texts. For instance, the novel as a form was once a radical departure from the poetic and dramatic works that preceded it, offering a new way to explore human experience in greater depth and complexity. As the world modernized, so too did the forms of literature—modernism, for example, emerged as a response to the disorienting changes of the early 20th century, breaking away from traditional narrative structures to capture the fragmented reality of contemporary life. This constant tension between preserving tradition and embracing change is what drives the evolution of literary conventions.

Technological advancements also play a crucial role in shaping these conventions. Indeed, conventions initially arise from the practicalities of communication. Oral traditions, for example, rely on repetition and formulaic structures to aid memory and ensure the survival of stories across generations. As societies transition to written forms of communication, the physical medium—whether stone tablets, parchment, or print—imposes its own constraints and possibilities, influencing the length, style, and structure of texts. With the advent of the printing press, the accessibility of literature expanded, leading to new forms like the novel, which could explore more complex plots and characters than had been possible in oral or even earlier written traditions. In our own time, the rise of digital media has sparked a reimagining of textual forms—hypertext fiction, blogs, and social media posts are all products of this new landscape, where the old rules no longer apply. As society continues to evolve, so too will the conventions of text, reflecting the ongoing dialogue between writers, readers, and the world around them.
