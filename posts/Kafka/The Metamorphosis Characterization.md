In this first scene of The Metamorphosis, Kafka employs various characterization techniques in order to present Gregor as alienated from society and from his own humanity and authentic self, quite in line with the existentialist themes of the story. We are made to understand that he is very apathetic towards the transformation, and more worried about his lack of true friends and his job, showing how the transformation has alienated him from society; that he doesnâ€™t know his new bug body, showing his alienation from himself; and finally he is described as a struggling, powerless bug, which alienates him from his own desires, as he is unable to get up for work, or even to turn onto his right side and fall back asleep.
