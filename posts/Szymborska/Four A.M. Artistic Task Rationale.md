My artistic interpretation of Four A.M. is a fully electronic musical interpretation relying on lofi sound design. Instead of conventional melodic and harmonic content, I focused on atmosphere and texture—mirroring the poem’s rejection of clarity and form in favor of a mood defined by liminality, discomfort, and existential weight. Szymborska’s speaker isn’t narrating a story or stating a thesis; they’re caught in a fragile, in-between moment. I wanted the music to feel the same way.

The most obvious sound design element is the clock ticking throughout the entire piece. The poem feels jittery, like the speaker is dealing with insomnia, as we can see in the title “Four A.M.” At 3 AM, some people are still awake. At 5 AM, others are already up. But 4 AM is a time only for insomniacs. The clock reflected this idea of the speaker attempting—but failing—to fall asleep, and being progressively more aware of the time passing.

The piece is structured in four parts, each more-or-less corresponding to a stanza of the poem.

Part I reflects the opening lines—“The hour between night and day. / The hour between toss and turn.”—which establish a surreal and disoriented atmosphere. I used vinyl crackle, reversed ambient textures, and the clock ticking to represent the sense of temporal dislocation and mental static. The reversed sounds create a feeling of unnatural motion, as if time is flowing backward, or not at all.

Part II builds on the imagery of nature reawakening and the poem’s shift into the uncanny: “The hour swept clean for roosters’ crowing. / The hour when the earth takes back its warm embrace.”  Here, I layered a bell riser, ambient wind sounds, and a pitched-down rooster sample—warped enough to sound eerie and unfamiliar. This is meant to blend the natural and the unsettling, mimicking how the poem shifts from the pastoral (“roosters’ crowing”) to the cosmic (“extinguished stars”) with subtle unease.

Part III represents the third stanza which describes 4 AM as an “Empty hour. / Hollow. / Vain.” I stripped the soundscape down to just the ticking clock and a distant, pulsing heartbeat which eventually stops. This sonic emptiness mirrors the poem’s own use of minimalistic, declarative lines. It’s a sonic void: no melody, no harmony, no direction—only the suggestion of time and the body, both barely holding on.

Part IV interprets the final stanza, especially the line “No one feels fine at four a.m.” and the absurdity of “If ants feel fine at four a.m., we’re happy for the ants.” I reintroduced the lo-fi drum pattern, which is intentionally fragmented—as if the beat is trying to hold itself together but can’t fully cohere. The lead melody is intentionally restless and jittery, reflecting the speaker’s own insomnia and uneasy, almost manic need to keep existing. The poem ends with a resigned “let five a.m. come / if we’ve got to go on living,” and my piece ends unresolved, clock still ticking—because that’s the whole point. The speaker doesn’t find peace or sleep or meaning, but time goes on.

The result is a sonic space that feels less like a song and more like a place—an unsettling, hollow hour suspended between two worlds.
